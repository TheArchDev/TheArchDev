## Hi there, I'm Alex 👋🏽

I'm a software engineer with experience in backend web development, cloud platforms and DevOps tooling and who has interests across the wider tech stack!

### Journey So Far

I started out in 2014 as a physics graduate before working in technology transfer for over a year. I transitioned my career to hands-on software development through a full-stack programming bootcamp in Costa Rica in 2016. Since then I've been part of product development & infrastructure teams spending time both as an individual contributor and as a people manager. I've been able to experience start-up as well as more corporate work environments. I took part in [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in 2021. I am currently based in London.
