## Hi there, I'm Alex 👋🏽

I'm a software engineer experienced in backend web development, cloud platforms and DevOps tooling and who has interests across the wider tech stack!

### Work experience

I spent 5 years working in healthtech as a backend developer / platform engineering manager at [Digital Surgery](https://www.medtronic.com/covidien/en-us/products/digital-surgery.html) (acquired by Medtronic in 2020), contributing to projects including
- [Touch Surgery Enterprise](https://www.medtronic.com/covidien/en-us/products/digital-surgery/enterprise-solution.html): a cloud-based, AI-powered surgical video and analytics platform for the operating room (involved web, mobile and hardware clients)
- [Touch Surgery Simulations](https://www.medtronic.com/covidien/en-us/products/digital-surgery/simulations.html): a library of interactive computer-generated and video-based surgical procedures (available on iOS and Android)

### Background

I started out in 2014 as a physics graduate before working in technology transfer for over a year. I transitioned my career to hands-on software development through a full-stack programming bootcamp in Costa Rica in 2016. Since then I've been part of product development & infrastructure teams both as an individual contributor and as a people manager. I've been able to experience start-up as well as more corporate work environments. I took part in [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in 2021. I am currently based in London.
